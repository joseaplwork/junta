# Project Overview

This is the Junta project - an application for managing "La junta", including creating juntas, managing groups, and handling user participation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS API (`apps/api/`)
- **Frontend**: Angular Admin App (`apps/admin/`)
- **Shared Code**: Reusable libraries (`libs/`)
- **Monorepo**: Nx workspace with npm

## Architecture Principles

### Single Responsibility
- Each component, service, or module should have one clear purpose
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Abstract logic into services, keep components focused on UI

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid over-engineering
- Only add complexity when truly necessary

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Identify and extract reusable patterns
- Place shared code in `libs/` folder
- Reuse existing abstractions before creating new ones

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add features until they're actually needed
- Avoid speculative generalization
- Focus on current requirements

## Code Quality

- Write readable, self-documenting code
- Avoid comments - let the code speak for itself
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Variable and function declaration are simple, they reflect intention, and rely context hierarchy

## Shared Code Location

Place reusable code across apps in the `libs/` folder:
- `libs/shared/enums/` - Shared enumerations
- `libs/shared/services/` - Shared services
